# WPSKit

WPSKit contains various tidbits of Swift code for iOS and Mac apps. This library is used at [White Peak Software](http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com) in in-house and client projects. WPSKit is licensed under the MIT license unless stated differently in the individual source files.

# Support, Bugs and Feature requests

There is absolutely **no support** offered for this library. You're on your own. If you want to submit a feature request, please do so via [the issue tracker on github](http://github.com/kirbyt/WPSKit/issues). Please note, however, new features will only be added if and when there is a need for the feature at White Peak Software. The primary goal of this library is to support White Peak Software projects, and a feature you deem as a "must have" might not be a must have for White Peak Software.

If you want to submit a bug report, please do so via the [issue tracker](http://github.com/kirbyt/WPSKit/issues). Include a diagnosis of the problem and a suggested fix (in code) with the report. If you're using WPSKit, you're a developer - so I expect you to do your homework and provide a fix along with each bug report. You can also submit pull requests or patches.

Please don't submit bug reports without fixes!
